This is a library implementing the Cangjie input method.

Below is a trivial example of how to use it:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cangjie.h>

int main() {
    Cangjie *cj;
    int ret = cangjie_new(&cj, CANGJIE_VERSION_3,
                          CANGJIE_FILTER_BIG5 | CANGJIE_FILTER_HKSCS);
    CangjieCharList *chars;
    ret = cangjie_get_characters(cj, "d*d", &chars);

    if (ret == CANGJIE_NOCHARS) {
        printf("No chars with code '%s'\n", "d*d");
        cangjie_free(cj);
        return 1;
    }

    CangjieCharList *iter = chars;

    while (1) {
        if (iter == NULL)
            break;

        printf("Char: %s, code: '%s', classic frequency: %d\n",
               iter->c->chchar, iter->c->code, iter->c->frequency);

        iter = iter->next;
    }

    cangjie_char_list_free(chars);
    cangjie_free(cj);
    return 0;
}
```

Development happens [on github](https://github.com/Cangjians/libcangjie2), and
stable release tarballs will be available when we reach that point.

Installation instructions can be found in the `INSTALL.rst` file.

## History

This library is based on
[Wan Leung Wong's libcangjie](https://github.com/wanleung/libcangjie).

In fact, when writing it, we tried to preserve the original libcangjie API,
because Wan Leung had done a pretty good job with it.

However, we felt the need to start afresh for a few reasons:

* due to real life constraints, Wan Leung didn't have any time to dedicate to
  libcangjie any more

* we felt that some of the technical decisions in the original libcangjie were
  not the wisest choice

Nevertheless, this library would probably not exist if Wan Leung hadn't opened
the way, so we feel it is important to give him credit.

Thank you very much Wan Leung!
